                Feel free to take anything from my website :3 <br>
                The internet is free after all!

                Credit is always welcome! But not required.
                Especially if you take large parts :3
                Just a comment with a link to my site is enough, but more is also fine!
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly, the web is free, take whatever you want! Nobody can stop you anyway :3 <br>
                I took a lot of stuff from other sites too, mostly to learn how it works.
