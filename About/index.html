            <hr>
            <p>
                I am really fascinated by <img src="/Images/Geocities/flashing computer.gif" width="25" height="25" class="va">computers and tech<img src="/Images/Geocities/flashing computer.gif" width="25" height="25" class="va">, 
                but I actually don't know that much about them. I wish to get more <img src="/Images/Geocities/book4.gif" width="25" height="25" class="va">knowledge<img src="/Images/Geocities/book4.gif" width="25" height="25" class="va"> about computers and tech, 
                but I'm too lazy to learn. <br>
                I am also very interested in programming, almost all my programming knowledge is self thought and little bits from school.
                That probably also explains why all my code is so bad and janky. <br>
                I live by "Code doesn't work, don't know why. Do some random things, code works still don't know why."<br>
                <br>
                I if you have taken a look around my website you will probably see that it has a unique style, this is
                because I think modern websites almost all look the same boring way. I like to spice up my site with all
                sorts of <span class="text-rainbow-animation-small il">silly and funny</span> gifs and images!<br>
                This really stems from discovering all the archived GeoCities pages on the <img src="/Images/Geocities/hourglass.gif" class="va" width="15" height="25"><a href="https://archive.org/web/">WayBackMachine</a><img src="/Images/Geocities/hourglass.gif" class="va" width="15" height="25">. 
                I really fell in love with how those websites looked, and as you can see, they inspired my own website!<br>
                Looking at GeoCities websites makes me nostalgic, even though I had never even heard of them when they
                were around. Because they shut down before I even had any device to surf the internet. 
                It's like nostalgia for a past I have never had, and it is a weird feeling to be honest. <br>
                This nostalgic feeling also extends to <span class="text-vapor-animation il">VaporWave and RetroWave</span> images, gifs and other media. They make me feel like a past I have never had and a future I will never have.<br>

            <hr>
            <p>
                I love to travel as well, I have mostly traveled within <img src="/Images/Flags/EU.png" width="24" height="16"> <span class="il" style="color: #003399;">Europe</span>. 
                The only times I have been outside of Europe is when I went to Aruba with my grandma. <br>
                Since my summer vacation in 2022 I have been collecting pins of each country I have visited. 
                In my collection are 10 pins total of which 7 are from different countries.<br>
                My pin collection started in Denmark, where I visited a tourist shop and thought "You know what? 
                from now on I'm going to try to get a pin in each country I visit."<br>
