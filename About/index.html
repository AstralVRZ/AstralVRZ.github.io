            I am <div class="text-ench-animation" style="display: inline;">Astral/Jea</div> pick whichever name you like for me more!<br>
            I am a 18 year old <div class="text-trans-animation" style="display: inline;">trans girl</div> <sup>She/Her/they</sup> that lives in the <img src="/Images/Flags/nederland_small.gif" width="23" height="16"><div class="text-dutch" style="display: inline;">Netherlands</div><br>
            I am from a city called <img src="/Images/Flags/Flag_of_Spijkenisse.svg.png" width="24" height="16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spijkenisse" target="_blank"><div class="text-spijk" style="display: inline;">Spijkenisse</a></div>, a city near Rotterdam.<br>

        <h2 class="headers">More about me!</h2>
        <p style="display: inline;">
            I am really facinated by <img src="/Old/Images/Geocities/flashing computer.gif" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align: middle;">computers and tech<img src="/Old/Images/Geocities/flashing computer.gif" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align: middle;">, but I actually don't know that much about them. I wish to get more <img src="/Old/Images/Geocities/book4.gif" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align: middle;">knowledge<img src="/Old/Images/Geocities/book4.gif" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align: middle;"> about computers and tech, but I'm too lazy to learn.
            I am also very interested in programming, almost all my programming knowledge is self thought and little bits from school, that probably also explains why all my code is so bad and janky. <br>
            I live by the "Code doesn't work, dont know why. Do some random things, code works don't know why."<br>
            <br>
            I if you have taken a look around my website you will probably see that it has a unique style, this is because I think modern websites almost all look the same boring way. I like to spice up my site with all sorts of <div class="text-rainbow-animation-small" style="display:  inline;">silly and funny</div> gifs and images!<br>
            This really stes from discovering all the arhived GeoCities pages on the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">WayBackMachine</a>. I really fell in love with how those websites looked, and as you can see, they inspired my own website!<br>
            Looking at GeoCities websites makes me nostalgic, even though I had never even heard of them when they were around. Because they shut down before I even had any device to surf the internet. It's like nostalgia for a past I have never had, and it is a wierd feeling to be honest. <br>
            This nostalgic feeling also extends to <div class="text-vapor-animation" style="display:  inline;">VaporWave and RetroWave</div> images, gifs and other media. They make me feel like a past I have never had and a futre I will never have.<br>
            <br>
            I love to travel as well, I have mostly traveled within Europe. The only times I have been outside of Europe is when I went to Aruba with my grandma. Since my summervacation in 2022 I have been collecting pins of each country I have visited. In my collectio nare are 10 pins total of wich 7 are from diffrent countries.<br>
            My pin collcetion started in Denmark, where I visited a touristshop and thought "You know what? from now on I'm goig to try to get a pin in each country I visit."<br>
            Since then I have only not been able to buy one when I went to Finland, which is a shame. Because in my opinion it is a beautiful country.
