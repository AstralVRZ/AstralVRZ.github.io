					<amber>[R]:</amber> Everyone ready for "The Job" tomorrow?
					<br><amber>[D]:</amber> Most certainly, but does anyone have the guard schedule for me again? I lost the file..
					<br><amber>[&#937;]:</amber> Bit too late if you don't know it off top of your head yet, but alright.
					<br><amber>[&#937;]</amber> Uploaded <blue>[GuardSchedule.xlsx]</blue> to the chat.
					<br><amber>[D]:</amber> Oh don't worry I studied it perfectly, I just need to confirm some small details.
					<br><amber>[VT]:</amber> You better have, because we CAN NOT afford to fuck up tomorrow.
					<br><amber>[&#937;]:</amber> So the plan for tomorrow again quickly, we meet up at the agreed upon meeting spot where Delta should be with a vehicle. At exactly 18:00 we leave the meeting spot and Delta will drive us to <a href="" style="color: blue;"><blue>[NeonLux Gems & Augmentations]</blue></a>. If we, due to traffic, arrive at the location after 19:00 we do not proceed, retreat unseen and reschedule. If we arrive at location before 19:00 we stay in the vehicle and wait until it's time. Exactly at 19:00 Red, VT and I walk into the store. Delta charges the vehicle while we are inside. Before we are in view of the camera's I will discretely activate and drop a camera scrambler.
					<br><amber>[&#937;]:</amber> While we are inside we pretend to look around the store and get to our positions. Red will stand near the counter on the side of the phone, and VT and I will take up positions on both sides of the entrance. At exactly 19:15 we reveal ourselves and Red places a scrambler on the phone on the counter. And VT and I will take out the guards, which should be two newbies according to the schedule. The VT and I smash the displays near the entrance and Red grabs anything of value that is on the counter. after that we leave the store, and while walking to the entrance Red drops a incapacitator in the center of the store. By this time Delta will have driven up to the entrance, and we make our way to the forest via the I-89 Loop highway. Delta should know at which point to turn off the highway.
					<br><amber>[D]:</amber> Hey uhm &#937;, how many people should be in this chat?
					<br><amber>[&#937;]:</amber> Only 4, why?
					<br><amber>[R]:</amber> &#937; do you ever look at the chat user count? I thought this plan consisted of 5 people, but after you only mentioned 4 people in the explanation I just had to ask.
					<br><amber>[&#937;]:</amber> I'm pulling the plug!
